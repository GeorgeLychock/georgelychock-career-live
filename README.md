### My User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

<h1 align="center">George Lychock Career Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://georgelychock.github.io/georgelychock-career/)

This is the main career website for George Lychock. It contains all the job, education, and professional development information for George Lychock. This site replaces my Bootstrap3 site that currently exists at www.georgelychock-career.com. I used a hybrid of the existing content, learned modules from the CI lesson plan, and other resources I have found along the way, but all the code is completely new and any 'borrowed or sampled' code is documented below and in html files.

-   ## User Experience (UX)
    Since this site will almost always be accessed by first-time users, the focus is on a more simple, less-busy design and navigation. Very few images. Precise and succinct content, fewer words, and more content flow. My old career site, based on Bootstrap3 was too word heavy. The mobile experience needs to be completely flawless and error free as I suspect that up to 50% of the traffic will be via mobile device.

-   ### User stories
    -   #### General User Experience
        -   **Story 1** As a Site Visitor, I want to have a persistent navigation element/method allowing me to jump to any site content quickly.

                1.  The most detailed Content is never more than **two clicks** away from home.

    -   #### Recruiter and HR Contact Experience

    -   #### Casual Visitor Experience
        -   **Story 5** As a Casual/AdHoc Visitor, I want to experience what is presently considered a basic, but effective and pleasing layout and responsiveness so I can learn by example and enhance my skills.
            -  ##### Acceptance Criteria -- Duplicated in Testing below
                1.  Mobile experience on Home page should not require a scroll to view entire Home page content (portrait view)
                2.  The Desktop Home page should offer more initial information on site content and offer a more robust nav that will not be displayed on the mobile view Home
                3.  Use at least one advanced Bootstrap components on the site.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The color scheme is dictated by the hero image color profile. The image is an original photo taken by myself at a machine shop class in 2018. The final color scheme will have to be iterated over to the R2 release given time contraints. The desire is to ultimately have a brighter/whiter color scheme.
    -   #### Typography
        -   Two Google fonts, Montserrat is used for headings and titles, Raleway is used for all running text and nav items.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Images are kept to a minimum. A hero image that corresponds to my PD/Education is used. There is an image of me on a profile page/section.
    -   #### Iconography
        -   Icons are used in nav elements, social media elements, using Font Awesome icons.
    -   #### Profile Page
        -   The Profile page has a different look and feel and Content Area struture than the other pages of the website; this will probably be upgraded in a R2 of the site.

-   ### Project Folder Structure
    -   All secondary html pages are located in the pages/ folder.
    -   All images are located in the images/ folder
    -   Any document content (eg resume pdf) is located in the content/ folder

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone6, iPad8.
-   Testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   A design professional friend of mine spent 30 minutes with me reviewing the overall design after all pages were constructed and styled.
-   All pages were given at least one cold read.
-   Used Lighthouse to identify areas on improvement which are documented below in Fixed Bugs after Testing.

### Fixed Bugs after Testing
-   Issue: On tablet viewports the My Profile Section overflows on the Credentials Section on Home page.
    -   Fix: Adjusted the row divs style to be completely responsive across all viewports, portrait and landscape. Also adjusted the My Profile links to take up less width.
-   Issue: Hero image does not properly fill the full viewport; mobile viewports either scroll or the site doesn't fil the entire screen leaving a black background visible at bottom.
    -   Fix: This was a major larger issue; properly sizing the hero image to fill the full height of the viewport was a blocker requirement. Started with a fresh shell for the Home page; properly added the hero image to fill full viewport on mobile; added section by section markup from the original Home page and fixed styles as needed. Followed [Bootstrap Documentation on Sizing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/sizing/).
-   Issue: On mobile view social nav icons do not center properly.
    -   Fix: Set padding to rem units on i element (Font Awesome icon).
    -   Justification: I have been using rem units on as much sizing as possible with the intention of a smoother responsiveness between viewports.
-   Lighthouse Issue: Site wasn't using rel="noreferrer" attribute on the a links
    -   Fix: Added the att to all a links
-   Lighthouse Issue: missing meta description tag
    -   Added the meta tag to all pages
